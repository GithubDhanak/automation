            The virtual environment identifier. This field should be set to a
            value that will uniquely identify the heat stack.

            WARNING: if a heat stack associated with the supplied ardana_env already
            exists, it will be replaced if this job is launched to create it.

            The target OpenStack cloud platform. Possible values are:

              engcloud  - the Provo engineering cloud (engcloud.prv.suse.net)
              susecloud - the Nuremberg SUSE cloud (cloud.suse.de)

            If the 'ardana_env' value matches one of the virtual cloud slots
            (https://ci.nue.suse.com/lockable-resources/), the 'os_cloud' parameter is
            overridden to reflect the OpenStack platform associated with it.

            The action to be performed:
              - create: create a new heat stack
              - delete: delete a heat stack

            If the create action is selected, a heat template needs to be supplied through the
            'heat_template' parameter.

          description: >-
            The name of the OpenStack project that hosts the heat stack in the
            'os_cloud' OpenStack cloud platform (leave empty to use the
            default shared 'cloud' account).

            If the 'ardana_env' value matches one of the virtual cloud slots
            (https://ci.nue.suse.com/lockable-resources/), the 'cloud-ci' OpenStack
            project used exclusively for the Cloud CI will be used regardless of
            this parameter.

            This field may be used to define additional parameters, one per line, in the form:

              <parameter_name>=<parameter-value>

            These parameters will be injected into the Jenkins job as environment variables that supplement
            or override the other parameters configured for the Jenkins job.
            This should not be used by default or regularly. It is meant to run job build customized in ways
            not already supported by the job's parameters, such as testing automation git pull requests
            with special configurations.
