# Rick suggested you could add the remaning nodes as lonelynodes to crowbar
# i did not do this it expects dhcp running on admin node whereas 
# i had it from subnet, this is one of the shortcuts i would prefer, didnt try

# so I did crowbar_register manually
# crowbar_register requires running locally or screen and not on ssh, so I had install screen which requires addiing repos.
# So I used the h_setup_base_repos functins above however crowbar_register does not like that, so just rm -rf  /etc/zypp/*

# once node were in ready state
./cloud9 proposal

# you will need to add a bridge on admin node with vlan-300 for "floating-ips" in the inner openstack to work
